Schmitt Trigger Design and Implementation using Cadence EDA Tools

Objective: To design and implement a Schmitt Trigger circuit using Cadence EDA tools, simulate its functionality, and analyze key parameters like hysteresis width, switching thresholds, and stability, helping to understand its behavior in noise rejection applications.


Overview
The Schmitt Trigger circuit is designed to provide hysteresis, which makes it useful in signal conditioning applications where noise immunity and sharp switching behavior are required. The goal of this assignment is to create the circuit schematic, perform simulations, and analyze its output characteristics under different input conditions.

Getting Started
Setting Up Cadence Virtuoso
Open Terminal:

Right-click and open the terminal window.
Enter the following commands:
sh
Copy code
csh
source /cadence/install/cshrc
virtuoso

Creating New Library & Schematic:

Library: File -> New -> Library, name it (e.g., VLSILAB_EXP_2), and attach it to the technology library gpdk045.
Schematic Cell View: Go to File -> New -> Cell View, set up the library, cell, and view as follows:
Library: Select your created library.
Cell Name: E.g., Schmitt_Trigger.
View: Schematic.
Adding Components and Connections:

Use the instance tool to add components such as nmos1v and pmos1v.
Add input and output pins, and make all connections using the wire tool.

Symbol Creation:

Go to Create -> Cell View -> From Cell View to generate the symbol automatically.
Customize the symbol if needed.
Simulation with Spectre
Set Up Simulation:

Launch ADE L (Analog Design Environment).
Set the simulation to Spectre and configure settings in Setup -> Simulation Directory/Host.
Specify Analysis Type:

Use Analysis -> Choose to configure settings for DC sweep or transient analysis.
Choose output voltages/currents to be plotted.
Run Simulation:

Execute Simulation -> Netlist and Run to simulate the Schmitt Trigger circuit.
Results
After simulation, verify the expected hysteresis characteristics of the Schmitt Trigger. The simulation should show distinct switching thresholds, with stable high and low states, demonstrating noise immunity.
